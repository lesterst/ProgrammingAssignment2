## These are the functions for programming assignment 2 that will
## create a special matrix object that can cache its inverse AND
## compute the inverse of that special matrix.  If the matrix has
## already been solved previously, then it will retrieve the inverse
## from the cache.

## The first function makes the special matrix object that can cache
## its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the matrix in the first function
## If the inverse has been calculated already, it gets it from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
